-- planned    

    - Allow the console to save and load snapshots. 
    - Snapshots should describe each thread separately.
    - Snapshots should allow incremental updates by sharing constant pools
    - Allow the user to load and save profiling projects.
    - Memory monitor should include more info
    - Add a thread state monitor
    - Use atomic variables to decrease monitor contention
    - Add an allocation tracer
    - Create tests
    - Improve graph layout algorithm.
    - Allow the user to hide methods in the call graph view
    - Provide a minimal bundled documentation
    - Provide some presets for Tomcat and JBoss
    - Add a menu option to check for newer releases
    - Show tooltips during startup

	- disable save button when there´s nothing new to save
	- load the last project when the console starts
	- show the connection status and project name in the title
	- show snaphost history
    - Fix call tree problems
    - allow the user to disable memory and thread monitoring

    - (new) many UI improvements
    - (new) added some internal stats to the agent and some other minor improvements

1.0-alpha7
    
    - (new) network protocol redesigned from stracth (no serialization)
    - (fix) deadlock when redefining classes in JBoss

    - default verbosity set to 1
    - (new) agent should redefine only really needed classes    
    - (fix) cannot close console onf agent error
    - (fix) console not exiting process when closed
    - (fix) Error redefining org.apache.tomcat.jni.OS class (being skipped now)
    - (new) replaced usage of monitors by reentrant locks (faster with high contention)

1.0-alpha5
  
    - (new) ultra-fast snapshot serialization (must less memory required)
    - (new) decreased memory overhead hugely
	- (new) unblocking UI when connecting/ desconnecting/ appying rules/ taking snapshots
	- (new) show enhanceable classes and allow the user to easly create rules
	- (new) validate agent and console versions in a network handshake
	- (new) show methods' details in the graph
	- (new) reduced the max number of visible methods in call graph
	- (new) minor UI improvements
	- (new) increased to 5 min memory monitor history
	- (fix) parsing of agent parameters  
	- (fix) client should disconnect cleanly when the user closes the window without an 
	        explicity disconnect
	- (fix) EOFException in remote JVM during disconnect
	- many refactorings
	
1.0-alpha4

	- (new) on-the-fly reconfiguration of the profiling agent	
	- (new) configuration parameters (waitconn e verbosity) for the agent command line	
	- (new) dialog to edit the profiling rules for the current session	
	- (new) improve visualization for recursive methods
    - (new) really improved call graph view based on well-routed splines    
    - (new) replace ptplot by jfreechart
        
1.0-alpha3
